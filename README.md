### Problem Statement/Opportunity :
	Existing System   
current e-commerce websites for shoes is the lack of specialized features and tailored experiences for sneaker enthusiasts. Many existing platforms offer a generic shopping experience that fails to cater specifically to the unique needs and preferences of sneaker enthusiasts.
Existing Trend in Current E-commerce Websites for Shoes:
The current trend in e-commerce websites for shoes revolves around providing a wide selection of products from various brands, offering basic search and filtering options, and facilitating standard payment methods. Some websites may also incorporate customer reviews and basic recommendations based on browsing history.
 	Why New System
